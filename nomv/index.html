                Mental health is a huge part of being able to lead a happy and fulfilling life. Depression, burnout and suicide is an ever-growing problem all around the world in almost all stages of life. The veterinary field however, unfortunately has a disproportionately high number of suicide cases and an even higher rate of depression. 
                At first glance, working as a veterinarian sounds awesome, you get to play with cute puppies, kittens and foals all day, right? There are several moments of pure joy and satisfaction when you witness a patient recover, feel better and wag its tail again for the first time. Helping those in need is actually quite fulfilling. Most of the time however, reality is much less glamorous than that. Veterinarians are extremely overworked, have to deal with euthanasia on a daily basis, even having to put down perfectly treatable furry friends and often get hated on for not being able to just treat the animals for free.<br><br>
                Veterinarians are animal lovers through and through, it's in their nature to want to help and heal. They struggle to say no, even though they actually can't do anymore. Being overworked, stressed, perhaps financially unstable makes dealing with euthanasia even harder than it already is. To a certain extent you are able to shut it out of your mind, otherwise you couldn't do the job. However, having to deal with euthanising sometimes perfectly healthy animals day after day while dealing with all the rest as well…eventually takes a toll. Having the love and passion to heal others, unfortunately often has the negative side effect of neglecting your own health and well-being. 
                People often say they couldn't be a veterinarian because they couldn't bare to euthanise an animal. What most people don't realise is that in many cases, euthanasia is the most humane option and the best course of action. When an animal is in untreatable pain and terminally ill, euthanasia allows the owners to say their final goodbyes and for their loved ones to pass on painlessly, without suffering any longer. Witnessing this day after day, in combination with depression, stress and suffering may lead to veterinarians treating euthanasia as a viable option as well. Having the means, in addition to all of the above, is what makes veterinarians so prone to suicide. 
                Veterinarians are not terminally ill patients, they are full of passion and drive to help others, let's help them in return by creating awareness to their cause. Visit NOMV for more details!

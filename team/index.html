                        I am Margreet Voermans- age was not required, but female-can give that secret. Trying to fix horses, they call it "equine surgeon". Although when buying meat I doubt what is exactly the difference in our jobs.<br><br>
                        The challenge to row the Atlantic has been in my mind since years, and luckily enough I met this fantastic crew. We all have our strong skills. Some people can kill fishes or pirates, others do logistics (do we have this person actually?), some people row. Myself, I am a good swimmer, in case we capsize.<br><br>
                        Our charity is NOMV- Not One More Vet. Unfortunately there is a high suicide in the veterinary group, and these people need help. We are used to euthanise and as we have the drugs in our cars, it is happening too often.<br><br>
                        Let's buy the boat and start rowing. We don't go for an adventure class, there is only one place in a race, and that's the number one.<br><br>

                    <p class="intro">
                        Hi, my name is Suzanne, Suus for friends and everyone else. Born in Maastricht on World Animal Day 1971 and only 3 years older than Margreet. In my younger years I studied psychology and economics and always worked in the hospitality industry. Since 2000 I have been trying to convince the Belgians that as a Dutch person it is possible to sell the Belgian national product, Belgian fries. And that works well. I've purchased a fantastic new building at a beautiful location in Bilzen, Belgium. <br><br>
                        It has never been my desire to cross the Atlantic in anything other than an airplane but when Margreet told me about her plan, and asked to participate in the TWAC, I immediately said YES. Still have to learn to maybe think before I say yes :). My 3 brothers think I'm doing this to match or even surpass our daddy, he sailed the ocean from Rotterdam to New York. Since he has passed away for several years, I think he can oversee our journey well and will be our guardian angel.<br><br>
                        Our team is international and 2 of our team members regularly work in the Arab states, hence our name is YallahGo (hup, let's go, go fast!!). It's a name that fits our personalities. Of course we will live up to our name and go for the best time! <br><br>
                        Taking a dangerous journey with 3 vets and the knowledge that the suicide rate in their business is one of the highest of all professions, it’s my desire and duty to make sure that each of us reach the English Harbour in Antigua. I’m 100% positive, problem solver and technically skilled. Another talent: when i do something, i do it thoroughly and well!!<br><br>
                        Together we are the perfect team!<br><br>
                        YALLAH GO!!!!

                    <p class="intro">
                        Hi everyone, I'm Alejandro but everyone calls me Ale. I finished vet school last year and I am working towards specializing in Diagnostic Imaging. Unfortunately I'm currently still recovering from a torn ACL sustained end of last year.<br><br>
                        I may still be recovering and restricted to physical therapy and light exercise, but that does not dampen my ambitions. I've pursued several endurance sports, having completed several half and full marathons as well as a variety of triathlons such as a half Ironman distance a few years ago. I was supposed to complete my first Ironman in 2020 but my dream had to be postponed due to COVID. In my free time I also enjoy climbing and long distance hiking with the Scouts.<br><br>
                        I had been exposed to ocean rowing before but never had given it much proper thought. When Margreet gave me the opportunity to join her team however, I just had to accept the challenge. It may be a long and daunting journey but nothing in life that is truly memorable comes easy. Day to day life is so comfortable these days, we forget how incredibly lucky we are. Embrace leaving your comfort zone and re-learn to appreciate the small and fundamental things in life.<br><br>
                        Having worked as a vet, I've experienced first hand how tough it is physically and just mentally draining. Mental well-being has been neglected for far too long in all aspects of life. Suicide, especially in the veterinary field is an ever growing problem that has to be addressed. By having NOMV as our charity of choice we want to create awareness for those that have an unwavering drive to help others while often neglecting their own health and mental well-being.<br><br>
                        A few cliché life mottos that have some truth to them and I try to live by: <br><br>

                    <p class="intro">
                        Hiya! My name is Manuel Alejandro, in the Arab world they call me Manuel Al Kabir which means the Great - El Grande! I am not of Arab origin at all, but I've been living all over the Middle East for over 6 years: Qatar, Kuwait, Dubai, Bahrain and now Saudi Arabia.<br><br>
                        Convinced by my family and my best friend I ended up in Veterinarian school, even though I just wanted to be a musician (I played the violin for over 20 years), a farmer playing with my cattle and horses or a professional Baseball player.<br><br>
                        I am from Venezuela, the most beautiful country in the world. Fuck yeah!
                        I'm a horse professional, rider, trainer, bringing 9 years of sport medicine, podiatry and breeding with international experience as veterinary doctor.
                        I am a multitasker, and whatever I set my mind to, it must be done in the best way possible, yes, the best, there's no room for second place.<br><br>
                        I never thought about rowing, perhaps in the CrossFit training only then I met this wonderful woman called Margreet, I think we got along immediately because she expends few years living in Colombia and I'm from Venezuela so she found somebody in the middle of the desert to practices her Spanish. She got a funny accent obviously.<br><br>
                        She talked about rowing few times, and her positivism, sarcasm and charisma really make me get stuck with the idea of doing sometime extreme (as everything I do) and this is just something that we are going to do because we feel it from our guts, mind and soul. Let's make It happen. YallahGo!<br><br>
                        The discipline, commitment, good habits, repetition, to fail and fear, GOING the extra mile, adding extra weight, making the scary move, taking chances, everything helps me to continue to progress and push forward with my daily goals, embracing the uncertain as I believe that the point of discomfort is the inflection point of growth. If we can rewire to get the comfortable being uncomfortable, you are an unstoppable force. Hard work pays off, stay hard.<br><br>
                        HARD WORK, patience, and a crazy optimism convince me that humans CAN do the impossible and that is what makes the ordinary Extraordinary.<br>
                        What if??? What's next???>>> YALLAHGO!!!
